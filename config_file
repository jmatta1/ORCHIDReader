# has the maximum 1023 events per buffer and the slowest detector pair is the
# two 3He detectors looking at the different detector configurations in both
# reactor on and reactor off shows that the worst mismatch comes in reactor off
# The main position had a combined 3He rate of 3.9Hz and a worst NaI pair rate
# of 5648Hz. This gives 262.3 seconds per 3He buffer and a min buffer length of
# 1.481 Million. In the long term out of the way position the combined 3He rate
# is 28Hz (giving 36.54 seconds per 3He buffer) and a worst NaI pair rate of
# 32383Hz, giving a minimum buffer length of 1.183 Million. So we set the buffer
# length to 1.8 Million to give some breathing room in all situations

# ORCHIDReader
The initial processing step for ORCHID data.

This code reads some configuration data and a raw file list then produces a time series of spectra
with various 1D and 2D root histograms and a small root tree.

It also generates a few raw text files meant to be used to fill an entry in the Overall Database and
to partially fill in the per batch database.
